# Git Integration

## Overview
This document outlines the Git integration strategy for the computor VS Code extension. The extension will use a Git wrapper library to provide controlled access to Git operations.

## Library Choice
We will use **simple-git** (or similar) as the primary Git integration library. This provides:
- Promise-based API
- TypeScript support
- Comprehensive Git command coverage
- Error handling
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Architecture

### Git Wrapper Service
A service layer that wraps the Git library and provides:
- Standardized error handling
- Logging and debugging capabilities
- Repository state management
- Command validation and sanitization

### Core Operations
The Git wrapper should support:
- Repository initialization and cloning
- Branch management (create, switch, merge, delete)
- Commit operations (stage, commit, push, pull)
- Status and diff operations
- Remote management
- Tag operations

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of Git errors
- User-friendly error messages
- Fallback mechanisms for common failures
- Validation of repository state before operations

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Basic Operations
- Repository detection and initialization
- Basic status and diff operations
- Simple commit and push functionality

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
- Branch management
- Merge conflict resolution
- Remote repository operations
- Tag and release management

### Phase 3: Integration Features
- VS Code integration (status bar, commands)
- Authentication handling
- Background operations and progress tracking

## Security Considerations
- Validate all Git commands before execution
- Sanitize user input for Git operations
- Handle credentials securely
- Prevent execution of arbitrary commands

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all Git wrapper methods
- Integration tests with actual Git repositories
- Mock Git operations for isolated testing
- Error scenario testing
