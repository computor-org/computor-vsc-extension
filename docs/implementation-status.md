2. Missing core features (GitLab integration)
3. Type safety issues
4. Performance problems with large datasets
5. Incomplete error handling

### Pre-Production Checklist
- [ ] Complete all P0 features
- [ ] Fix all security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Achieve >80% test coverage
- [ ] Complete performance optimization
- [ ] Full documentation
- [ ] Error monitoring setup
- [ ] Deployment automation

## Next Development Phase

### Week 1-2 Focus
1. Fix authentication security
2. Complete GitLab integration
3. Address type safety issues

### Week 3-4 Focus
1. Performance optimizations
2. Error handling improvements
3. Testing coverage increase

### Week 5-6 Focus
1. UI/UX enhancements
2. Documentation completion
3. Production preparation

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas
1. **Authentication**: Security vulnerabilities
2. **Performance**: Poor scaling with data
3. **Type Safety**: Runtime errors possible
4. **GitLab Integration**: Core feature missing

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Security audit and fixes
2. Performance profiling and optimization
3. Strict TypeScript enforcement
4. Prioritize GitLab implementation

## Conclusion

The extension is approximately 65% complete with core functionality working but significant issues in type safety, security, and performance. Critical missing features like GitLab integration and proper authentication need immediate attention. With focused effort on the identified priorities, the extension can reach production readiness in 6-8 weeks.
